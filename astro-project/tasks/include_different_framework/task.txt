You can integrate different frameworks inside Astro. First you have to include the frameworks.
It is pretty simple just go in the terminal and type in 'npx astro add nameofframework'.
Task:
1.Include one Vue component and svelte component then display it in the index.astro.
2. Include client:only="svelte" to the svelte component and client:only="vue" to the vue component.
If you want you can switch it to see that the components are not beeing loaded or loading something else then the component (for example: [object Object]).
It only renders when the framework name is the same then the component

This is called Template directives reference:
