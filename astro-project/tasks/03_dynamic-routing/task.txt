you can create multiple routes inside one file with dynamic routing.
Inside your frontmatter you will be using the function getStaticPaths() that returns an array of objects

tasks:
1. Create a new directory with the name Employee and a astrofile with the name [employeeName].astro
2. Inside the [employeeName].astro use the function getStaticPaths() and return an array of objects.
Inside the object use { params: { employeeName: 'Julian',  },props: { someString: "Moin" }, }
Now you have a new Route:http://localhost:4321/Employee/Julian
